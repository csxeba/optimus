# Entertrain

This library contains some more exotic neural network optimization techniques.
The intention is to be compatible with multiple backends like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, etc.

Some plans on the algos to be implemented:

- Feedback Alignment (FA)
  - Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA)
  - Indirect Feedback Alignment (IFA)
- Decoupled Neural Interface / Synthetic Gradients (DNI/SG)
- Target Alignment (TA)
- Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
- Evolutionary optimization:
  - Genetic Algorithm (GA)
  - Evolution Strategies (ES)
  - Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES)
  - Neroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
